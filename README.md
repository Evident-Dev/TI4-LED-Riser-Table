# TI4 Hex Riser Firmware

ESP32-S3 firmware for a 61-hex Twilight Imperium 4 LED riser table. Dual-core architecture: Core 0 runs the LED strip task (I2S driver, ~60 fps), Core 1 runs the game state machine, keyboard polling, serial commands, and AsyncWebServer.

## Core Architecture

| Core | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Core 0 | LED task (~60 fps via I2S) — timing-critical, isolated from WiFi jitter |
| Core 1 | `loop()`: game state machine, keyboard polling, serial command handler; AsyncWebServer |

The LED task runs independently at ~60 fps. Game state writes to shared `hexColor[]` directly; the LED task picks up changes within one frame (~16ms) with no explicit sync needed.

## First Boot

1. Open Serial Monitor at **115200 baud**
2. The board will attempt to join the configured WiFi in `config.h`, then fall back to AP mode
3. Connect your phone or laptop to WiFi **"TI4-HexRiser"** (password: **"twilight4"**) if using AP mode
4. Open a browser and navigate to the IP shown in Serial Monitor (AP mode default: `http://192.168.3.1`)
5. The hex grid should appear and sync live with the LED state via WebSocket

## Web Interface

All live pages share a single WebSocket (`/ws`). The board pushes LED
state as a binary frame (all 366 hex sides) only when something changes, plus
a game-state JSON every 300 ms — no polling.

If no game state arrives for 1 second the pages show a **Table offline** splash and keep reconnecting. While the controller boots they show **Table is booting** until the boot animation finishes, and after a restart they reload themselves so they always match the firmware.

| Page | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Everyone | Home page with links to Admin, Player and Projector |
| `/projector` | Projector / TV | Full-screen live board mirror, display only |
| `/play` (or `/player`) | Players 1-8 | Phone keypad: claim a seat, then a phase-aware pad (color select, strategy cards, end turn / pass / battle, ready, agenda) |
| `/admin` | Game master | Desktop and mobile. Live board with hex claiming, player count, force start, reset, phase jumps, rules toggles, seat roster with kick, speaker token, battle, lighting |
| `/settings` | — | WiFi, LED, debug, and display settings at runtime |

### Playing from phones

1. Game master opens `/admin` and sets the player count (this restarts setup and assigns home hexes)
2. Each player opens `/play` on their phone, enters a name, and grabs an open seat
3. Seats survive phone screen locks and reconnects — the claim token is stored in the browser
4. Every keypad press goes through the same `handleGameKey()` path the physical keyboards will use

### Rules options (admin page)

- **Agenda needs custodians** (default on) — the agenda phase is skipped after status until the custodians token leaves Mecatol Rex. Claiming the center hex on the board marks it automatically; the admin can also toggle it.
- **4 players: 2 cards each** (default on) — in 4-player games each player picks two strategy cards, going around the pick order twice. Initiative is the lowest card held.
- **Speaker token** — no card grants the speaker token; when Politics changes the speaker, use the crown button on the seat roster.
- **Turn override** — during the action phase, the Turn button on a seat makes it that player's turn. Play continues in initiative order from them.

## Power Loss Recovery

Once a game has started, the controller saves it to flash whenever something changes: a turn ends, a player passes, a card is locked, a hex is claimed, or the phase changes. A save either completes or leaves the previous one intact, so a power cut mid-save can't corrupt it.

After a power loss, every page shows **Saved game found** with the phase and player count:

- Players and the admin can **Resume**. The admin can also **Start New Game**, which discards the save.
- On resume, seats come back **reserved**. Each phone stores its seat token with the game ID and rejoins its own seat automatically. Anyone else can still take a reserved seat, so a phone that never comes back doesn't block the game.
- The active player's turn timer restarts.

The save is cleared by Start New Game, Reset Game, or changing the player count. Nothing is saved during setup, so a new setup never prompts.

## Settings Page

Open Settings from the admin page to change runtime settings. Changes to LED and debug options take effect immediately. WiFi credential changes require a reboot.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Home SSID / Password | Home network to connect to first |
| AP SSID / Password | Fallback access point credentials |
| Home Timeout | How long to wait for home network before switching to AP |
| Default Brightness | Startup brightness (0-255) |
| Max Brightness | Hard cap for the brightness slider |
| LED Update Rate | Animation tick interval in ms |
| Broadcast Rate | How often the board pushes state to the browser (ms) |
| Side Gap | Inset of the colored side lines in the browser (0 = touching, higher = more gap) |
| Simulate Hardware | Skip FastLED.show() -- use this when testing without the strip connected |
| Debug flags | Enable serial logging for various subsystems |

## Serial Commands

Open Serial Monitor at **115200 baud**. All commands are case-insensitive where noted.

### Game Simulation Commands

These simulate physical keyboard presses and game flow for testing without hardware.

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `setplayers <4-8>` | Set how many players are active and restart the setup phase |
| `kb <1-8> <0-15>` | Simulate player N pressing key K on their keyboard |
| `startgame` | GM force-start: locks any unlocked players and runs speaker selection |
| `phase <0-4>` | Jump directly to a phase (0=Setup, 1=Strategy, 2=Action, 3=Status, 4=Agenda) |
| `battle <P1> <P2>` | Trigger battle mode between two players (e.g. `battle 1 3`) |
| `status` | Print current phase, all player states, home hexes, and WiFi IP |

### Keyboard Key Reference

Each player has a 4x4 keyboard (keys 0-15). What each key does depends on the current phase:

| Key | Setup phase | Strategy phase | Action phase | Status phase | Agenda phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-8 | Select color (preview only, not locked yet) | Select strategy card 1-8 | -- | -- | -- |
| 13 | -- | -- | End battle mode | -- | -- |
| 14 | -- | -- | Pass this round (on your turn) | -- | -- |
| 15 | Lock in color choice | Lock in strategy card and hand off | End turn | Mark ready | End agenda (speaker only) |
| 0 | Start game (any player, only after all locked) | -- | -- | -- | -- |

### Full Round Walkthrough

The board boots with 6 players active by default. To simulate a complete round:

**Setup phase (color selection)**
```
status                  check starting state
setplayers 4            use a 4-player game for simplicity
kb 1 1                  P1 previews Red
kb 1 15                 P1 locks Red
kb 2 2                  P2 previews Blue
kb 2 15                 P2 locks Blue
kb 3 3                  P3 previews Green
kb 3 15                 P3 locks Green
kb 4 4                  P4 previews Yellow
kb 4 15                 P4 locks Yellow
kb 1 0                  GM starts game -- speaker roulette runs, then moves to Strategy
```

**Strategy phase (card selection)**
```
status                  check pick order (speaker goes first)
kb 1 1                  current picker selects card 1 (Leadership)
kb 1 15                 picker locks card, next player's home hex starts pulsing
kb 2 4                  next picker selects card 4 (Construction)
kb 2 15                 locks, next picker
kb 3 6                  selects card 6 (Warfare)
kb 3 15                 locks
kb 4 8                  selects card 8 (Imperial)
kb 4 15                 locks -- all done, center pulse plays, moves to Action
```

**Action phase (taking turns)**

Initiative order is determined by card number (lowest card = first turn).
```
status                  check initiative order
kb 1 15                 active player ends their turn, passes to next
kb 2 15                 next player ends turn
kb 3 14                 P3 passes this round (home hex dims to 50%)
kb 4 15                 P4 ends turn
kb 1 15                 P1 ends turn again (cycling through non-passed players)
kb 2 14                 P2 passes
kb 4 14                 P4 passes
kb 1 14                 P1 passes -- all passed, moves to Status automatically
```

**Status phase (end-of-round cleanup)**

The board splits into radial slices, one per player, each pulsing their color.
```
kb 1 15                 P1 marks ready (their slice goes solid)
kb 2 15                 P2 marks ready
kb 3 15                 P3 marks ready
kb 4 15                 P4 marks ready -- all ready, moves to Agenda automatically
```

**Agenda phase**
```
status                  check who the speaker is
kb 1 15                 speaker ends agenda -- round resets, moves back to Strategy
```

## LED Map

Each hex has 15 LEDs across 6 sides. The strip enters each hex mid-side:

```
Side 0 (top):          2 LEDs  -- slots [base+14, base+0]
Side 1 (top-right):    3 LEDs  -- slots [base+1,  base+2,  base+3]
Side 2 (bottom-right): 2 LEDs  -- slots [base+4,  base+5]
Side 3 (bottom):       3 LEDs  -- slots [base+6,  base+7,  base+8]
Side 4 (bottom-left):  2 LEDs  -- slots [base+9,  base+10]
Side 5 (top-left):     3 LEDs  -- slots [base+11, base+12, base+13]
```

Where `base = hex_index * 15`. Hex 30 is the center hex.

## Power Notes

- At 50% brightness (default 128): approximately 27.5A draw from LEDs
- At max brightness (200): approximately 44A
- Minimum recommended PSU: 5V 60A
- Connect PSU ground to ESP32 ground
- Do not power the LED strip from the ESP32 3.3V or 5V pins

## Troubleshooting

**Serial port not detected:** Install the CH343 driver from WCH (see Driver section above). Use the UART USB-C port, not the data port.

**LEDs don't light:** Check GPIO 13 data wire, confirm PSU is powered, verify shared GND between PSU and ESP32-S3. On ESP32-S3, avoid GPIO 0, 45, 46 (strapping pins) for LED data — GPIO 13 is safe.

**Web page won't load:** Confirm you are connected to the correct WiFi; check Serial Monitor for the IP address.

**WebSocket not connecting:** Hard-refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R). If the board rebooted, the WebSocket client reconnects automatically within a few seconds.

**Animation not showing in browser:** Enable "Simulate Hardware" in Settings when testing without the strip connected.

**Compile error — FASTLED_USES_ESP32S3_I2S not defined:** The `#define FASTLED_USES_ESP32S3_I2S` line in `TI4_HexRiser.ino` must appear before `#include "led_control.h"`. Do not move or remove it — the ESP32-S3 I2S driver is required for FastLED to work on this chip.

**Wrong colors:** Edit `LED_COLOR_ORDER` in `config.h` (try `GRB`, `RGB`, or `BGR`).

**Compile errors — ESPAsyncWebServer:** This library must be installed manually from GitHub (me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer and me-no-dev/AsyncTCP). It is not available in the Arduino Library Manager.

**Watchdog reset / core panic:** If the LED task triggers a watchdog, increase the `vTaskDelay` in `ledTask()` or reduce `LED_UPDATE_MS` in `config.h`.

**PSRAM not detected:** Confirm **Tools > PSRAM > OPI PSRAM** is selected in Arduino IDE. The N16R8 module has 8MB Octal SPI PSRAM — if disabled, large buffers may cause heap exhaustion.
